          <h1>Scott Quintana</h1>
          <h3>iOS Developer · Drummer/Producer</h3>
          <br>
          <p>I live in Nashville, by way of Boston, Austin, and Los Angeles. I moved here nearly 10 years ago to pursue a career a music, and since have been touring full time with artists such as Kacey Musgraves, Charlie Worsham, Kree Harrison and several others. I have always loved working with computers though. My grandma was a COBOL programmer when I was young, and that early exposure to the tech world eventually lead to me being a web developer for most of my high school years. </p>
          <br>
          <p>I’m a curious person by nature, combined with a love of being creative, and a love for solving problems. After my last tour ended, I knew it was a good opportunity for me to get back to the programming world that I have missed for the last 20 years. Although the day to day tasks of my two careers paths may differ quite a bit, they both really come down to working with a team to create something great, and situations like that where I feel I’m at my best. </p>

            <h2>Cart Flow</h2>
            <br>
            <p>Cart Flow was born out of a personal need for efficiency in grocery shopping in the time of COVID. This
              app
              was developed specifically in mind to add both custom items to your list and the assigned aisles each
              product can be found in. By listing items by aisle, you can spend less time trying to find each item and
              less time in the grocery store. This app utilizes Core Data and Diffable Data Sources.

            <h2>Active Dispatch</h2>
            <br>
            <p>
              Active Dispatch connects you to the Metro Nashville Police Department via their public API and displays
              all
              active police calls. The active calls are viewable in a list and via a map view. The individual incidents
              are assigned a color, depending on their category and threat level. When using the map view, clicking on
              the
              individual incidents offers a specific location and more information. Active Dispatch utilizes UIKit,
              however, the inspiration came through some recent SwiftUI projects (programmatic UI, gradients, reactive
              color changes, and the MVVM architecture).

            <h2>WeatherApp</h2>
            <br>
            <p>WeatherApp was my excuse to use a combination of technologies that I really enjoy: SwiftUI and Combine.
              Having a UI that could quickly react to whatever data might be coming it's way was easy to implement with
              this pairing, and with Core Location being integrated too, there is no setup involed. You simply open the
              app, it detects where you are, and gives you the corresponding weather. Once finished with the main app, I
              thought it would be fun to make a widget to go along with it, allowing you to see your hourly forecast
              whenever you look at your home screen.

            <p>Top Headlines simplifies the news experience by showing you one story at a time, similarly to dating
              apps. Dependent on the users’ interest in the headline, they can use the buttons on the bottom of the UI
              or a swipe gesture to add to their reading list or pass the story. Once the feed of headlines has been
              exhausted, you can switch to your list, read each article, and check them off as you go.
